Toy Robot
============

Overall Design:

When a Robot executes commands generated by CommandsGenerator, it first asks an ExecutionPlanner whether the execution is safe. The Robot executes it if safe and ignores the command if otherwise.

A Robot is initialized with a NullPoint and a NullDirection. Before executing a command, the robot sends a message to its Point or Direction object for advice of where to go.
